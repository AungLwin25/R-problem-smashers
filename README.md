# R-problem-smashers

Welcome to R-Problem-Smashers, a collection of R code solutions designed to tackle real-world challenges in data analysis, visualization, and programming!  

**What you'll find here:**

* **Practical solutions** to common and not-so-common problems encountered in data science and analytics projects.
* **Clear explanations** of the code and the underlying concepts, helping you understand the "why" behind the solutions.
* **Examples** demonstrating how to apply these solutions to your own datasets and projects.

**Repository Structure**

* **`.csv` format:** The comma-separated files (csv) contain the source datasets used in the problem-solving examples.
* **`.R` suffix:** Files ending with `.R` contain the R scripts showcasing the solutions to various challenges.
* **`Problem sets`** are organized by the same index code. Check the file convention for the topics of the showcased functions.
* **`File naming convention`** lists the code and data sets while **`Scenario sets`** explains the purpose of code and data of each set.

**Explore, Learn, and Contribute!**
